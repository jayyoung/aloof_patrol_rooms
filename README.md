# aloof_patrol_rooms

This script allows the robot to continuously patrol between the six desks in the simulation environment. It patrols to a desk waypoint, points the PTU down slightly and waits for a few seconds before moving along. We'll replace the waiting with tabletop perception or image gathering.

Sometimes requires a nudge, as it can get stuck on door frames.
